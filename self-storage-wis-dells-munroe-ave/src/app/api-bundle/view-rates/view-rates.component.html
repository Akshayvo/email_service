          <p class="justify">Move in: This option will allow you to select and pay for your storage unit. You’ll be able to move in immediately. You will be charged
            for prorated rent for the current month, an $11 move in fee, and if today’s date is near the end of the month it will also assess next
            month’s rent.   A Docusign rental agreement will be sent to your email address after you complete the online move-in process. If you
            do not complete the Docusign rental agreement, we may deny access to the unit.  Please call our phone number to obtain a lock to your
            unit prior to moving in.</p>
            <p class="justify">Reserve a unit: <b>DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE IF YOU WANT TO MOVE IN WITHIN THE NEXT 48HRS.</b> You may reserve a unit up to two weeks in
              advance. After reserving a unit, you’ll need to complete the rental process at a later date either in person or via phone with
              our manager. Use this option if you will not be moving in right away.  </p>
