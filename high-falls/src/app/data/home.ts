            our 90,000 square foot warehouse has remained a storage facility for over 190 years.  The building’s
            two-foot thick medina sandstone façade and solid post and beam construction allow for thousands of
            pounds of storage material to be stowed safely and securely.  In 1998 our building underwent a historic
            renovation. A multi-phased project, all with a major emphasis placed on maintaining the historic nature
            of the building. The result was a storage facility that incorporates historic characteristics with
            modern amenities.`,
