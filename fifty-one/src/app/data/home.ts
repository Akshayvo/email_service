I find the fees very reasonable as well!”`,

It’s a very clean, brand-new facility. The location is easy to access, and it is extremely secure with both an outer gate and a locked door to the interior corridor, as well as a lock included for our storage unit. Most of all, Tony was wonderful to work with. He was always accessible by phone and spent a lot of time answering questions and explaining the procedure. I would definitely rent here again in the future.”`,
