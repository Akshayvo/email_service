        you move in but we do not pro-rate when you move out. We give you two keys for the cylinder lock and you can provide your own
        padlock in addition, if you wish. The cylinder lock is spring-loaded so you have to push in on the key and turn to open it
        and then pull the cylinder out. If you wish we can put you on autopay where we will charge your credit card on the first of
        the month; otherwise, you have to pay monthly by stopping in or setting up your account on this website to pay online. Autopay
        provides you with the convenience of knowing that your rent is paid on time and the assurance of avoiding any late fees.`,

        you must return the two keys and sweep the unit clean when you move out to get your full deposit back. It can
        take up to two weeks for us to process your deposit refund.`,
