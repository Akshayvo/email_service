Not only was the staff completely responsive and kind during the research into something that would fit my huge classic car but, when it became no longer necessary to house her, they assisted me completely and professionally with the ending of my contract with no additional fees. There was an additional time when I requested to have my payment put off a day or two as auto draft and they responded that same hour and were able to accomplish that for me. The unit itself was clean and weather proof, as described. The facility was secure with access being easy for me and available as I needed. Rebecca is the contact person and she was nothing but professional and helpful. Awesome place to work with. Highly recommend!”`,
